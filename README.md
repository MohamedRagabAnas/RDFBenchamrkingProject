# RDFBenchamrkingProject

#Description: 
RDF is the standard data model of the semantic web and Linked Data [1]. The last years have witnessed a great growth in the RDF data generated in different application domains [2]. This growth has led to thinking of new approaches and mechanisms of processing, querying and storing this large RDF dataset. The aim of this project is evaluating the use of Spark-SQL [3], the library for querying large structured and semi-structured data, for processing large RDF datasets under diverse conditions such as the underlying schema (Single Statement Table, Property Tables or Vertically-Partitioned Tables), and underlying Storage Formats such as (HDFS, Parquet, or AVRO).
